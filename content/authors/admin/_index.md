I am a Senior Education Researcher at <a href="https://www.rti.org/">RTI</a>, engaging primarily in education and social research and evaluation work. I have worked in the research, evaluation and accountability domain in several large, urban school districts including Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools, the School District of Philadelphia and Broward County Public Schools, as well as in the research consulting industry in the latter part of my career. My interests include statistical programming, statistical modeling, and the use of applied research and evaluation methods for informing policy and practice. I am certified in the Institute for Education Sciences' <a href="https://ies.ed.gov/ncee/wwc/">What Works Clearinghouse</a> Group Design and Regression Discontinuity Design Standards.
